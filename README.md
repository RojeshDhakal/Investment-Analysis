# Investment Analysis

This project analyzes my current holdings in my Sharesies account, focusing on US investments. The goal is to assess whether the assets I hold are good or bad investments, and to identify strategies for maximizing returns and minimizing risks. I will also determine how the assets should be allocated in order to optimize my portfolio.

In this repository, I will primarily evaluate my US stock portfolio. Future notebooks will focus on my Australian (AUS) and New Zealand (NZ) stocks, which will be analyzed separately.

## Methodology

This analysis leverages a variety of methods learned through my course to assess and optimize the portfolio. The primary focus is on optimizing the asset allocation to minimize risks and maximize returns.

Key techniques used in this project include:

- **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)**: Used to evaluate the risk-return profile of individual assets.
- **Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage**: A statistical technique used to estimate the covariance matrix with more stability.
- **Semicovariance**: A measure of downside risk, helping to assess negative volatility.
- **Black-Litterman Model**: A model that allows for combining market equilibrium with investor views to determine an optimal asset allocation.
- **PyPortfolioOpt**: A Python library that helps in optimizing portfolio allocations.

## Optimization Techniques

Optimization techniques aim to find the best combination of assets that minimize risk and maximize return. In this analysis, I focus on:

- **Minimizing Risk**: Identifying which assets have higher volatility or risk, and reducing exposure to them.
- **Maximizing Return**: Identifying the assets that offer the best returns in relation to their risk.

## Optimal Allocation

After performing optimization, the model will suggest the ideal allocation for each asset in the portfolio. The final allocation will help guide investment decisions to balance risk and return effectively.

## Future Plans

In future notebooks, I will narrow down to the most widely accepted and effective optimization techniques in the industry. Each model will be refined and improved based on industry standards to create a robust portfolio that aligns with my financial goals.
